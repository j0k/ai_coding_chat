Deepseel Thinking:
Okay, let's break down how I would approach creating the prompts to develop this AI coding chat application. First, I need to understand all the features the user wants in Version 2.0. From the previous conversation, the user mentioned adding a Session Switcher, Metadata for queries, Dark/Light mode, Project Explorer, Preset Prompts, and Code Update ability. 

Starting with the core structure, I'll outline the main components. The application needs a GUI, so using Tkinter makes sense. The main window will hold different panels like the chat area, navigation, toolbar, and project explorer. Each of these panels should be modular for easier maintenance.

Next, the Session Manager. Handling multiple sessions requires a way to switch between different conversation histories. I'll need a session class to store each session's data, including messages, metadata, and context states. The session switcher in the UI could be a tabbed interface or a list that allows users to switch between open sessions.

Metadata tracking involves adding timestamps, model versions, and code context to each message. This means modifying the message data structure to include these fields and ensuring they're saved and loaded correctly during session exports/imports.

For Dark/Light mode, I'll need to implement a theme system. Tkinter allows styling with ttk, so creating a theme manager that switches between different color schemes and saves the user's preference is essential. This might involve dynamic widget styling updates when the theme changes.

The Project Explorer needs to display the current directory's file structure. Using a Treeview widget to show files and folders, along with right-click context menus for file actions (open, rename, delete), would be necessary. Integrating this with the chat allows users to reference files in their queries.

Preset Prompts should be stored in a JSON file for easy editing. The UI could have a dropdown or a panel with buttons for common prompts. When a user selects a prompt, it populates the input field, possibly with placeholders for variables like language or code snippets.

The Code Update Assistant requires integrating a code editor component. Libraries like Pygments can provide syntax highlighting. When the user edits AI-generated code, the application should track changes and allow sending the updated code back to the AI for further suggestions. A diff viewer would help compare versions.

Error handling and performance optimizations are crucial. Network requests should have timeouts and retries. Large files in the Project Explorer need efficient loading to avoid UI lag. Background threads can handle tasks like file indexing without blocking the main UI.

Security considerations include validating file paths to prevent unauthorized access and encrypting sensitive session data. User preferences and preset prompts should be stored in secure, well-structured configuration files.

Testing each feature incrementally is important. Start with the core chat functionality, then add sessions, metadata, theming, and so on. Ensuring that all components work together without conflicts is key. User feedback mechanisms, like status messages and error dialogs, will improve usability.

Documentation and code comments will help maintain the project. Using version control to manage changes and track issues is a good practice. Finally, packaging the application for distribution, possibly with PyInstaller, will make it accessible to end-users without requiring Python setup.

Throughout development, keeping the code modular and following best practices (like MVC architecture) will make future enhancements easier. Regular refactoring and code reviews can maintain code quality. Prioritizing features based on user needs and technical feasibility ensures a functional and user-friendly application.
